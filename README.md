🌊 Identification of Flood-Prone Areas in Urban Settlements 🌍

🛠️ Overview

Flooding poses a significant risk to urban areas, leading to widespread damage to infrastructure, disruption of livelihoods, and threats to human lives. As climate change continues to make weather patterns more erratic, the need for effective flood management in urban environments has become increasingly urgent. This project aims to address this critical issue by identifying and mapping flood-prone areas within urban settlements using advanced geospatial techniques.

🏆 Presentation and Recognition

This project was proudly presented at L&T's Techgium Hackathon 🎓, a prestigious event that brings together innovative solutions to real-world challenges. The project stood out for its comprehensive approach to flood management, utilizing cutting-edge technology to address one of the most pressing issues in urban planning.

🎯 Objectives

🗂️ Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathering relevant geospatial data, including satellite imagery, topographical information, and hydrological data.

🌐 Topographic Analysis: Analyzing the terrain to identify features such as elevation, slope, and land cover that contribute to flood risks.

💧 Hydrological Modeling: Simulating water flow and accumulation patterns based on factors like rainfall intensity, soil type, and land use.

📊 Vulnerability Assessment: Assessing the vulnerability of urban areas by considering physical, social, economic, and environmental factors.

🗺️ Mapping and Visualization: Creating detailed maps that visualize flood-prone areas to support urban planners and disaster management authorities.

🧪 Methodology
